Running klipz from the command line will present a character-based clipboard
manager using curses. The user can scroll through past clips and save some
to a special "Saved Clippings" screen. Lots of other features, and great
configurability through a config file that can have python functions in it.

Install with "pip install klipz", see https://github.com/ropg/klipz for the
documentation and issue tracker.
